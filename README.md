# About

My first single page project to know me better.


Few words about me:

-HTML (I know)

-CSS (I can quote text vertically)

-JS (I'm learning but I can do few things)

-ReactJs (I'm learning)



I would love to work with:

 -ReactJs (I want to learn)

 -JS (I want to improve it)

 -Sass (I want to practice it)
